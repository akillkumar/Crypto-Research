## Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) 

Starting Reading Papers: 

* [ON DATA BANKS AND PRIVACY HOMOMORPHISMS (OnDataBanks)](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/Crypto-Reading/blob/master/FHE/OnDataBanks.pdf). 
* [Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data (FHe-gentry)](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/Crypto-Reading/blob/master/FHE/FHE-gentry.pdf). 
* [Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers (FHEInt)](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/Crypto-Reading/blob/master/FHE/FHEInt.pdf).
